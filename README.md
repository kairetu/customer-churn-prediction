# customer-churn-prediction
Machine learning project to predict customer churn using Telco dataset
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based and service-oriented businesses. The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to stop using a companyâ€™s services based on their behavior and demographic attributes.
Using a telecom dataset, I built a machine learning model to identify key factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights to help businesses improve customer retention.
This project covers the full data science workflow from data cleaning and exploration to feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
